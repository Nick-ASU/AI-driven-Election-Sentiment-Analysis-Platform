# AI-driven Election Sentiment Analysis Platform

My goal with this project is to develop an AI-driven platform for real-time sentiment analysis during election periods. By analyzing data from various sources like social media, news articles and public comments, the platform provides insights into public opinion trends and shifts.

## Usage (local right now, to be on the cloud soon)

1. Preprocess the labeled data:

python src/data_preprocessing.py

2. Train and evaluate the sentiment analysis model:

python src/sentiment_analyzer.py

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed data files
- `backend/`: Contains the source code files for data preprocessing and sentiment analysis
- `tests/`: Contains the test files for different components of the project
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages and their versions
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for the project
